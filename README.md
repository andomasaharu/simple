about simple.lisp  
simple is small-step semantics research project  
and large-step semantics
on Common Lisp  
debug or check on [CLISP](http://www.clisp.org/)  
for studying computer programming semantics  
and CLOS  

use CLOS so emphasis OOP polymorphism  
all OOP(object-oriented programming) strength is dont explicit write if/else/switch/case statement  
it is not in the other merit  
true OOP merit is polymorphism only  
usually to eye OOP merit is inheritance, capsule, private or public function ..nadonado  
i doubt, these merit  
save input action afford  
save electricity  
finally ecology for earth  
save the human(specially programmer)  
oh, yeah Common Lisp  

impliments :  
integer number  
adder  
multipler  
boolean  
lessthan  
variable (and environment)  
statement (assign)
if then else
sequence
while
evaluate (possible large-step)  

executable example:  
1 * 2 + 3 * 4  
1 + 2 < 6  
x + y  
x = x + 1  
if 1 < 1 then y = 1 else y = 2
x = 1 + 1; y = x + 2
while x < 5 then x = x * 3

about dfa.lisp
dfa is a Deterministic Finite Automaton  
emulate at finite state machine  
it is simple, small, easy to understand, easy to implementation  
as pc without large ram, hdd, io, multi processor, 
also on Common Lisp  

impliments :  
accept 1 character  
accept string
